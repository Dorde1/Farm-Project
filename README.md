# Farm-Project

INTRODUCTION

This is a a farm project which includes several type of livestock. The basic information about the livestock are stored in an access database.
Main task was to develop a GUI application that retrieves the data from the database, stores it in efficient data structures, manipulates it and reports useful information
related to the profitability of the farm.

THE ACCESS DATABASE

The information in the access database is the main input of this program and it provides a clear picture of the different type of livestock and the associated data.
The database includes five tables: Cows, Goats, Sheep, Dogs and Rates and prices.

TASK AND REQUIREMENTS

Main task is to develop an application using C#.
Each livestock has a unique ID.
One of the main operation that your application must support efficiently is: the user enter an ID and the application display the information associated with this particular livestock. The livestock could be a cow (possibly Jersy cow), dog, sheep or a goat.
The most efficient data structure for this operation is the hash table.
